# Project 2: CSS Presentation

## Due: Monday, November 9, 2015, 3 p.m.

### Instructions

Using a corrected version of your HTML résumé, create a styled version for *web* and *print* using Cascading Style Sheets.

You have the freedom to be creative in how you present your résumé. It should, however, demonstrate proper visual design techniques, utilize proper site architecture and adhere to best practices.

This assignment is worth **15 points.**


### Requirements

By now, you should have taken the time to correct the HTML version of your résumé from project one based on feedback from your professor.

We will be looking for the requirements of a well-structured HTML document set forth in project one, including:

- Valid HTML (checked using the [W3C HTML Validator](http://validator.w3.org/))
- Presence of HTML5 structural tags (i.e. `header`, `nav`, `main`, `section`, `article`, `footer`) as needed
- Proper use of hierarchical (`h1-h6`) tags
- Properly encoded HTML entities
- Use of appropriate tags for marking up content
- No use of presentational elements in HTML

To demonstrate proficiency using CSS and site architecture, your project should:

- Be organized (i.e. use of `css`, `img` directories, with `resume.html` at the root level)
- Use style sheets which adhere to best practices (i.e. indentation, parallel organization to HTML)
- Display well in Google Chrome
- Exhibit use of box model properties (i.e. use of margin, padding, border)
- Include at least one simple layout technique (i.e. center a containing element, float elements, etc.)
- Include at least two, well-paired web fonts from a provider such as [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts)
- Avoid "design sins" (see below)

To show an understanding of designing for different media, your project should also incorporate a style sheet which makes your résumé appear as if it were created exclusively for print. Therefore it should:

- Use a serif typeface
- Use print units (points, inches, centimeters, millimeters, etc.)
- Eliminate unnecessary interactive elements

In general, your document should:

- follow best practices as specified during lectures
- be free of spelling errors
- be free of broken links / broken images

### What are design sins?

Most students who take JMM 341 have previously taken a multimedia design course.

For those who haven't, or need a quick refresher in design principles, the following resources should be helpful:

- *HTML & CSS*, pp 465-472

- [Code School: Fundamentals of Design](http://courseware.codeschool.com/FoD_optimized.pdf)

- [Viking Code School: Principles of Visual Design (12-20)](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/web-design-basics)

Ultimately, your designs (web and print) should avoid the following:

- Things that blink
- Warped photos
- Naked photos (photos lacking a border)
- Bulky borders, boxes
- Cheated margins
- Alignment issues
- Centering everything
- Clutter
- Trapped white space
- Busy backgrounds
- Tacky type
- Mismatched colors
- Bad bullets


### Tips

- Sketch out a the way you want your resume to look before you start. This will provide you with a reference point as you code.

- Start from the top of your HTML document. Code the styles which will be inherited (`body`). Then move on to the header, then nav ...

- Depending on the design you sketched, you may have to add or modify your HTML. You may even decide to re-do the entire HTML document. **This is okay.** Just make sure any change you make to the HTML validates before continuing with styling.

- Save yourself a headache using git and GitHub: Continue the process where you left off. Make any necessary changes to `resume.html`, add and commit the files, then push to GitHub. If you delete `resume.html` and start anew, remember git is still tracking those old files!)

### Submission

By now you should have all required software installed on your computer and familiar with Git and GitHub. You should also have created a repository to host your web pages (`<username>.github.io`) as was required in the Git & GitHub assignment.

**[Create an issue](https://github.com/umiami-web-design/project-presentation/issues) in this repo with *your name* and a link to your *username.github.io* repo by the deadline. If you are unsure of how to submit, check the example provided in the Issues section.**

You should commit (approximately) three files: `resume.html`, one `.css` file for the web version of your site and one `.css` file for the print version.

Do not wait until the last minute to submit your URL.


### Grading

One quarter of a point (0.25) will be be deducted for projects that do not meet the presentational requirements. Failure to attempt a print style sheet will result in a *two (2) point deduction*.

One half point (0.5) will be deducted for projects that do not meet the structural requirements, including broken links, spelling errors or lack best practices as specified during lectures.

*You have received ample feedback and have had multiple opportunities and time to correct the errors in project one.* **Do not make the same mistakes again because now they will hit your grade twice as hard.**

Failure to submit the assignment to GitHub as detailed above will result in an additional *five (5) point deduction*. This includes an incorrect repo name and/or file name.

A missed deadline (submitting the assignment, for instance, at 3:00:01 p.m.) will result in a *two (2) point deduction for every day the assignment is late*.

**Plagiarism or lapses in web ethics, as detailed in the course syllabus, will result in a zero (0) on the assignment, PLUS a 15-point penalty on your final grade and referral to the University of Miami Honor Council**.

**Good luck!**
